The $\\varepsilon$-greedy method eventually performs better because its exploration of other actions in search of the optimal one.

For instance, noisier rewards (higher variance) increases the long-term advantages of exploring the action space and, thus, make $\\varepsilon$-greedy more efficient. On the other hand, with low variances, the greedy method would quickly find the optimal action and then never explore. But even in the deterministic case, there is a large advantage to exploring if we weaken some of the other assumptions, such as non-stationarity."
