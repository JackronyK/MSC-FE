    "\n",
    "A major drawback to the DP methods above is that they involve operations over the entire state-space. If the dimensionality of the states is very large, then even one evaluation can be computationally expensive. This is known as the *curse of dimensionality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous DP algorithms are iterative algorithms that update the values of states in any order, using whatever values of other states happen to be available. The values of some states may be updated several times before the values of others are updated once. For convergence, the asynchronous algorithm must still update the values of all the states at some point in the computation. Asynchronous DP algorithms allow great flexibility in selecting states to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, synchronous value iteration waits until all states are updated in order to obtain a new value function. That is, to obtain $v^{(1)}(s)$ we use the value function $v^{(0)}(s')$ obtained in the previous iteration. A version of asynchronous DP, named \"in-place\" value iteration, exploits at each iteration whatever new updates of $v^{(1)}(s')$ exist at the time of updating to estimate $v^{(1)}(s)$. That is, in every \"sweep\" or loop that goes through the state space we compute $v^{(1)}(s)$ using new updates $v^{(1)}(s')$ available in other states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is to update a selection of states that generated the highest updating error in previous steps of the iteration. This is called \"prioritized sweeping.\" We can maintain a queue of a certain number of states that receive priority when updating, reducing the computational burden of each sweep through the state-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method, which we will cover in Module 7, is to use \"Real-Time DP\" that updates the optimization objects according to the experience obtained by the agent in the environment, leaving aside \"irrelevant\" states. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following example extends the investor problem we developed at the beginning of this module. The example is meant to provide a view on the large amount of computing time that might be needed to solve a seemingly simple model and how asynchronous DP with \"in-place\" value iteration may help.\n"

Thus, the action space is $\\mathcal{A}=\\{hold,sell\\&buy,sell\\}$. The state space is a three-dimensional array that includes the dividend realizations of each asset and which asset the investor is holding, which we denote by the variable $pos$.

    "DP may not be practical for very large problems but is actually quite efficient. The worst-case computational time that DP methods take to find an optimal policy is polynomial in the number of states and actions. In this sense, DP is exponentially faster than any direct search in the policy space because direct search would have to exhaustively examine each policy to provide the same guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, current computers can efficiently solve problems with millions of states using DP methods. Both policy iteration and value iteration are widely used; which method is better depends on the application at hand. Also, note that each dynamic programming problem has its own specificities and, although sharing the general characteristics stated above, require a careful formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above, we have dealt with discrete spaces of states and actions. This considerably simplifies the exposition and coding. If any of the spaces takes values in a continuous set, for computation we need to rely on function approximation and interpolation to obtain the optimal policies at each point. These methodologies fall out of the scope of this course. "
